# UFOs
# Overview
Our aim is to create a functional webpage that clearly and aesthetically diplays the data from the data.js file. 

#### Resources
Data source: data.js
Vs Code
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Bootstrap

## Results
Using Javascript and HTML, we have created a page that diplays UFO data. We have the ability to filter through the data to show sightings based on date, city, state ect.
- You can filter by date

-By city

-You can also filter by multiple criteria. (country ans shape)

## Summary
Although the webpage was completed successfully, it coud use a few user friendly updates. The filter section is case sensitive, so we're unable to return results when searching capitalized words. I would recommend the ability to sort the page by the individual coloumns. Also make the filter section into dropdown lists, because currently the user needs to already know the search criteria to return results on every search.
